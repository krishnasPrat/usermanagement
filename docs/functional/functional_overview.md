# Functional Overview (Pictorial)

## What This User Management System Does

- Manages users, roles, and permissions scoped to each AWS service.
- Lets a super user subscribe to services and onboard sub-users per service.
- Applies default role permissions and supports special permission overrides.
- Ensures permissions are only granted within the subscribed service.
- Provides clear separation between service configuration and user access.
